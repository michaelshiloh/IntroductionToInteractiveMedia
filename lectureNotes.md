### Tuesday 29 August 2023
#### Today
- Introduction (to the course, to each other, etc.)
- Introduction to programming (if we have time)

#### Introduction to class
* Join Discord (invitation link is in Brightspace)
* What are some examples of IM projects? 
	Spend a few minutes Googling 
	and put links in Discord
* What is IM?
	- Discussion
* Homework, projects, and grading
	- Most of you come into this class with different 
		backgrounds, skills, and knowledge, so 
		in IM, we grade by creativity, imagination, communication, 
        effort and progress, 
		not by a fixed level of accomplishment.
	- In IM we strongly encourage experimentation, thinking outside the box,
		and risk taking. 
		However taking risks is only possible 
		if failure doesn't have catastrophic results. 
		If failure results in a poor grade, 
		how does that encourage risk taking?
		- Discussion
		- MVP
* Phone and laptop policies
	- Discussion

* Introductions

- Syllabus etc.

- Introduction to programming in p5.js
- Primitive drawing functions
- How to tell where you are on the canvas
- Homework (see weekly schedule above)

#### Let's get started

##### Simple shapes in p5.js

Open the p5.js editor by visiting editor.p5.js

If you don't already have an account on p5.js you might want to do so now, or
after class. If you do it now you can save what you do in class

type this in:

```
function setup() {
  circle(50, 80, 30);
  square (80, 30, 40);
}
```

- `circle()`
- `square()`
- `ellipse()`
- `rect()`
- `fill()`

Spend a few minutes playing with this

### Thursday 31 August 2023
#### Today
- Accounts: p5js.org, Wordpress, Discord
- Review
- More about programming in p5.js
- Homework

##### Variables

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200,200);
  let foo = 20;
  circle(50,50, foo);
  square (90, 90, foo);
}
```

Now let's break this down one step at a time
- `setup()`
- `circle()`
- `let`
- `createCanvas()`

More primitive drawing functions

- `triangle()`
- `line()`
- `point()`

What does this all mean?
- Functions
- Variables
- Arguments or parameters
- Order of execution
- Computer does what you tell it to do, not what you are thinking
	- Errors happen when what you tell it is different from what you want it to
		do

Controlling color, fill, and stroke

- `stroke()`
- `noStroke()`
- `fill()`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, 180)`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, radians(180), CHORD)`
- `background(240)`

##### In-class exercise

Working in pairs, try to make a simple picture of a house 

##### What did you discover?
- Anything surprising?
- Any questions?

##### Big hint #1
Sometimes it's hard to know the coordinates of where you want to put stuff.
Wouldn't it be nice if you could put your mouse somewhere, and have the
computer tell you the coordinates of that point?

Good news everyone!

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200);
  background(220);
  print(mouseX + "," + mouseY);
}
```
What's going on here:
- `print()`
- Built-in variables `mouseX` and `mouseY`
- Build strings of characters using the `+` sign

but that's not very useful. Why does it only print the coordinates once?
- Hint: the function `setup()` only runs once at the beginning. Maybe there is
	another function that runs more than once?

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  print(mouseX + "," + mouseY);
}
```

# Woah!

If the `draw()` function runs continuously, can we use it to make things
change?

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200);
	let xPosition = 0;
}

function draw() {
  circle(xPosition, 50, 30);
	xPosition = xPosition + 1;
}
```

##### Why didn't that work?

Variable scope:

```
let xPosition; // this is now a global variable

function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200);
	xPosition = 0; // don't recreate the variable, but do initialize it
}

function draw() {
  circle(xPosition, 50, 30);
	xPosition = xPosition + 1;
}
```

##### Built-in variables
- `mouseX`, `mouseY`
- `width`, `height`
- many others; we will discover more as we go along


### Tuesday 5 Sep 2023
#### Today
- Review
- Homework
- Notes on variables
- Animation, Conditionals, Loops

##### Pause

Many of you already know the material we cover in these first few weeks
so why sit through class?
- This is not a coding class. This class includes design and critique
- Since you already know how to code, your creativity
	and critical thinking will be judged to a high standard
- I expect full attention and engagement. Doing something not related to class
	is rude, disrespectful, and will result in a reduced grade. The
	cellphone/laptop rules that we discussed last week is really about
	attention and respect, not about technology
- Please use the restroom before class. 
    We will take frequent breaks in class. 
    If you need an additional break please ask me when is a good time. 
    If you regularly require more frequent breaks please discuss with me
    privately or request an accommodation from the Moses Center

#### Homework
- [Homework schedule](https://intro.nyuadim.com/). Note the deadline
    "Assignments due midnight before first class of following week"
- Late homework
- Let's look at some of your homework

#### Notes on variables
Javascript is not a typed language: you don't need to declare
	a variable's type
- `let myNumber = 4.5;`
- `let myString = "the quick brown fox";`
- `let myArray = ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"];`
- `let myRandomNumber = random(255);`
- `let myRandomNumber = round(random(255));`

It's important to be aware of the difference between a variables name and
a variable's value

How can we find out what a variable's value is?
`print()` 

##### Notes:

- Local vs. Global variables
- Built-in variables

````
// Example usage of a global variable

let count; // this is now a global variable

function setup() {
  circle(50, 50, 30);
  count = 7; // the variable is initialized here
}

function draw() {
  count = count + 1; // not algebra!
  // The result of the right hand side calculation
  // replaces whatever value was stored in the variable
  // on the left side of the '=' sign
  // end result: the variable "count" is incremented by 1

  print (count);
}
````


#### Animation, Conditionals, Loops

##### Animation

Use the `draw()` function to draw something different in each frame. This can
be the location of a shape but you can manipulate anything such as color also:

The  `draw()` function is called once per frame. Think of it as drawing a new
page on a ["flip book"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_book)

````
let foo = 0;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {
  ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  foo = foo + 1;
}
````

By default, the previous frame is not erased. Sometimes this is useful.
Use the `background()` function to "paint" over any previous drawings. 

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(500, 500);
}

let triangleTopLeftX = 0;
let redValue = 255;

function draw() {
  // erase previous drawings
  background(10, 255, 255);

  // Move the triangle
  triangleTopLeftX = triangleTopLeftX + 1;

	// If the triangle reaches the right edge, move to the left edge
  if (triangleTopLeftX >= width) {
    triangleTopLeftX = 0;
  }

  // Change the value of red
  redValue = redValue - 1;

	//If red reaches a certian level, reset it
  if (redValue === 55) {
		redValue = 255;
	}

  // Select the fill for the triangle
  fill(redValue, redValue - 100, redValue - 100);

  // Draw the triangle
  triangle(
    triangleTopLeftX,
    20, // top left corner
    triangleTopLeftX + 100,
    30, // top right corner
    triangleTopLeftX + 50,
    200
  ); // bottom corner
  
  // Select the fill for the circle
  fill(10,20, 240);

  // Draw the circle
  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 30);
  print("mouse coordinates = " + mouseX + ", " + mouseY);
}

````

##### How often does the `draw()` loop run?

````
function setup() {
  frameRate(10);       // frameRate() is a function
  print(frameRate()); // framerate does not change immediately
}

function draw() {
  print(frameRate());
}
````

##### Conditionals 

One of the most important features of computer programming is the ability to
do different things based on the outcome of some previous event 

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {
  if (mouseIsPressed === true) {
    background(0, 0, 255);
  } else {
    background(200, 0, 0);
  }
}
````

**Notes**:
1. `mouseIsPressed` is another built-in variable. There are many others.
1. `mouseIsPressed` is a new type of data, namely a `boolean`, 
	which means it has
	 only one of two values, `true` or `false`
1. Note that `{` and `}` indicate the blocks
1. The `else` part of an `if()` statement is optional (what happens if we
	 remove it?)

In class exercise:
- Using the cursor to draw
- Now use a mouse press to clear the screen
- Clear the screen if the mouse is pressed inside a certain circle
- Combine these to create a primitive painting program

[Here](https://editor.p5js.org/michaelshiloh/sketches/izE0kdT_Q) is the
example that we developed in class

### Thursday 2 February 2023

#### Today
- Questions, review, etc
- Painting program
- Loops

##### Painting program
- Vladimir's
[paint program](https://editor.p5js.org/vsharkovski/sketches/0E5JFi1Pk)
- Jun's
[paint program](https://editor.p5js.org/ojmjunming/sketches/8GQSFuizb)

##### Loops

- `while()` is like `if()` but it keeps on doing it as long as condition is true
	- Whereas `if()` does it only once
	- The assumption is that something changes while you're doing the loop which
		might eventually make the condition false, otherwise you'd be stuck there
		forever
- `for()` is a variation in structure but basically does the same

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  let foo = 50; // create and initialize a variable

  while (foo < width) { // keep going as long as the condition is true
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
		// modify the variable so something different happens next time
    foo = foo + 50; 
  }
}
````

1. You should get in the habit of giving meaningful names to your variables.
	1. What is a better name for the variable foo?
1. What would happen if you replace the `while()` with `if()`?

Another example:

````
function setup() {
  let done = false;
  let counter = 0;
  while (!done) {
    print(counter++);
    if (counter >= 10) {
      done = true;
      print("done");
    }
  }
}
````

There is another way to make a loop using the keyword `for()`. The `for()`
loop structure combines the initialization step and the incrementation step
into the `for()` loop construction:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  // initialization, condition, and incrementation all in one line
  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50)  {
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  }
}
````

Which should you use? Whichever is easier for you to understand. Remember that
**most of the time spent programming is fixing problems**, and **whatever you
understand best will probably have fewer problems**.

Both `for()` loops and `while()` loops can be nested, meaning a loop inside a
loop:

```

function setup() {
  createCanvas(700, 700);
  background(230);
  fill(0);

  let yPos;
  let xPos;

  for (yPos = 30; yPos < height; yPos=yPos + 40) {
    for (xPos = 20; xPos<width; xPos=xPos + 40) {
      circle(xPos,yPos, 5);
    }
  }
}

```

Note that I've done all the above looping examples in `setup()` and not in
`draw()`, so there is no animation in these examples. Loops can be used in
`draw()` as well.


### Thursday 7 Sep 2023
##### todays-lecture

#### Administration
- Attendance
- TouchDesigner
  [workshop](https://intro.nyuadim.com/2023/09/05/touchdesigner-workshop/) Sunday 4:30-7:00

#### Today
`random()`, `noise()`, and the concept of state


##### Grids
- An [example](https://editor.p5js.org/itp42/sketches/dBeLZC8mm) by Prof.
	Mathura showing how to create and move in a grid

##### Randome numbers with `random()`

- `let foo = random();`
- `let foo = random(5);`
- `let foo = random(5, 22);`
- `let foo = random([some array]);`

Random example 1:

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(700, 700);
  background(230);
  fill(0);

  for (let yPos = 30; yPos < height; yPos=yPos + 40) {
    for (let xPos = 20; xPos<width; xPos=xPos + 40) {
      circle(xPos,yPos, random(1, 5));
    }
  }
}

```

Random example 2:
```
function draw() {}

function mouseClicked() {
  background(50 * random(6),
             50 * random(6),
             50 * random(6));
}
```

##### Perlin Noise

```
function draw() {
  background(204);
  let n = random(0, width);
  line(n, 0, n, height);
}
```

What if we wanted the line to move in a more organic, lifelike
fashion? Organic things (e.g. butterflies, leaves blowing in the wind, clouds) 
don't jump instantly from one place to another,
they tend to move close to where they were last time

Perlin noise example 2:
```
let offset = 0.0;

function draw() {
  background(204);
  offset = offset + .01;
  let n = noise(offset) * width;
  line(n, 0, n, height);
}
```
Perlin noise example 2:
'''
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);

  for (let yPos = 0; yPos < height; yPos = yPos + 40) {
    for (let xPos = 0; xPos < width; xPos = xPos + 40) {
      offset = offset + .1;
      square(xPos+noise(offset)*20, yPos+noise(offset)*20, 40);
    }
  }
}
let offset = 0.0;
'''

Things to notice:

- Why is the variable `offset` global? (Remember our discussion of variable
	scope)


##### State

From Wikipedia:

"... a system is described as stateful if it is designed to remember preceding
events or user interactions; the remembered information is called the state of
the system. "

Example:

'''
let currentState = 0;

function setup() {
  background(currentState);
}

function draw() {}

function mouseClicked() {
  if (currentState === 0) {
    currentState = 255;
  } else {
    currentState = 0;
  }
  background(currentState);
}
'''
