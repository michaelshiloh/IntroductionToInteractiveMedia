### September 10 2020

#### Administration

- **Record Zoom!**
- **Connect to Zoom 10 minutes early**
	- This is to make sure you have time to fix any potential Zoom issues
	- You may keep your camera and mic turned off until class time

**Processing**

#### Simple shapes

- `ellipse()`
- `rect()`
- `size()`
- `triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)`
- `line()`
- `point()`

What does this all mean?
- Functions
- Arguments or parameters

Controlling color, fill, and stroke

- `color()`
- `stroke()`
- `noStroke()`
- `fill()`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, 180)`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, PI, CHORD)`
- `random()`

Confused? 
- Google
- Processing reference page

#### Variables
- `int myNumber = 45;`
- `int myRandomNumber = random(255);`
- `int myRandomNumber = round(random(255));`
- Other variable types. `int` is by far most common, another common is `float`
- Built-in variables
	- `width`, `height`
	- many others

Here is an example Processing program (also called a 'sketch') 

````
size(400, 400);
ellipse(width/2, height/2, 50, 50);

/*
stroke(0,255,0);
fill(255,0,0);
//ellipse(100,100, 50, 50);

fill(255,0,0, 30);
//rect(30, 30, 50, 80);


// Now I will try to draw an arc
//arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, radians(180), CHORD);

// pick a random number up to 180
float myRandomArcSize = random(180);
int arcSizeAsInt = round (myRandomArcSize);
println(myRandomArcSize + "   " + arcSizeAsInt);

// convert that number to radians
float arcSizeInRadians = radians(myRandomArcSize);

print(myRandomArcSize + "    " + arcSizeInRadians);

// draw the arc
arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, arcSizeInRadians, CHORD);
*/
````


Time permitting, go further
	
#### Animation
- `draw()`
- `setup()`

````
int foo = 0;

void setup() {
  size(300, 300);
}

void draw() {
  ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  foo = foo + 1;
}
````

`background()`

`frameRate()`

Yesterday we were able to draw without using `setup()` and `draw()`. What's
the difference?

Static vs. active mode

#### Interaction with Processing

- conditionals

````
void setup() {
  size(300, 300);
}

void draw() {
  if (mousePressed == true) {
    background(color(0, 0, 255));
  } else {
    background(color(200, 0, 0));
  }
}
````

**Important concepts**:
1. `mousePressed` is another built-in variable. There are many others.
1. `mousePressed` is a new type of data, namely a `boolean`, which means it has
	 only one of two values, `true` or `false`
1. Note that `{` and `}` indicate the blocks
1. The `else` part of an `if()` statement is optional (what happens if we
	 remove it?)

- Two more interesting built-in variables: `mouseX`, `mouseY`
	- Using the cursor to draw
	- Now use a mouse click to clear the screen
	- (Time permitting, primitive painting program)

#### Loops
`while()` is like `if()` but it keeps on doing it as long as condition is true

````
void setup() {
  size(300, 300);

  int foo = 50;

  while (foo < width) {
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
    foo = foo + 50;
  }
}
````
You should get in the habit of giving meaningful names to your variables. What
is a better name for the variable foo?

### September 15 2020

#### Administration

- **Record Zoom!**
- **Connect to Zoom 10 minutes early**
	- This is to make sure you have time to fix any potential Zoom issues
	- Once connected you may keep your camera and mic turned off until class time

#### Portraits

Look at some portraits. Ask if you want to know how something was
accomplished.

#### Review

- ````setup()```` and ````draw()````
- ````background()````
- Conditional statements using ````if()````
- Loops using ````while()````

#### ````for()```` loops

````for```` is very similar to ````while()```` but combines three steps in
one:

````
void setup() {
  size(300, 300);

  for (int foo = 50;foo < width; foo = foo + 50) {
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  }
}
````

- Discussion leading rubric
	- Review instructions for [student-led
		discussion](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/master/syllabus.md#student-led-discussions)

#### Functions

Every time you use one of the built-in 'commands', you are really using (or
more properly 'calling') a built-in function. Functions are a very important
building block of programming, and in addition to using built-in functions,
you can also create your own. In fact, you've already been doing that, when
you created the `setup()` and `draw()` functions. In the case of
`setup()` and `draw()` you have to use those names, but when you create other
functions you can make up your own names. Just like variables names , good 
function names make your programs easier to understand.

Why create your own funtions?

- Reuse
- Clarity (remember the three reasons for clarity: yourself, sharing,
	grading)
- Easier to debug (what is debugging?)
	- One of the most powerful ways to approach
	a bug is to reproduce it with simplest possible example. 
	This is much easier when the thing that's causing
	the problem is already a function.
- Modularity
- Flexibility (with good choice of parameters)

Review basics of functions from last week

#### Variable Scope

````
int foo;  // this is a global variable, visible in all functions
void setup() {
  foo = 7;
}

void draw() {

  println(foo);

  int bar; // this is a local variable, visible only inside of draw()

  for (int i = 0; i < width/2; i++) { 
    // i is a local variable visible only inside this for() loop
    ellipse(i, height/2, 10,15);
  }
}
````

In class exercise:

1. Write a function that will take a single parameter
and draw a vertical line from the top of the canvas to the bottom
at the X coordinate incidated by the parameter
	1. In the ````draw()```` function test this function 
	at a couple of different locations
1. Write another function that will draw a **horizontal** line
at the indicated **Y** coordinate
	1. Test as before
1. Using these two functions, write a program in ````draw()````
that draws a grid of lines at regular intervals on the canvas

Discussion:

- What debugging methods helped you find and fix problems?
- What other functions might be useful?
- What other parameters might be useful?

Here is the program that Shaurya developed:

````
void setup() { 
  size(500, 500); 
  background(255);
} 

void draw() { 
  vlineMaker(0, 50); 
  hlineMaker(0, 50);
} 

void vlineMaker(int x, int xstep) { 
  while (x<width) { 
    line(x, 0, x, height); 
    x = x+xstep;
  }
} 

void hlineMaker(int y, int ystep) { 
  while (y<height) { 
    line(0, y, width, y); 
    y = y+ystep;
  }
}
````

#### Motion

Let's use make a ball bounce on the floor. First, make a circle move:

<pre>void setup() 
{ 
  size(500, 500);
  x = width/2;
} 

float speed = 5;
float x;
float y = 0;

void draw() {
  background(150);

  ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);

  y+=speed;
}
</pre>

Now, make it change directions when it hits the floor:

<pre>void setup() 
{ 
  size(500, 500);
  x = width/2;
} 

float speed = 5;
float x;
float y = 0;

void draw() {
  background(150);

  ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);

  y+=speed;

  if (y>=height) {
    speed = -speed;
  }
}
</pre>

Now, do two thing: 1) use gravity to increase its speed as it falls and 2) reduce its speed on each bounce:

<pre>

float gravity = .1;
float speed = 0;
float x = 320;
float y = 0;

void setup() 
{ 
  size(500, 500);
} 

void draw() {
  background(150);
  ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);

  y+=speed;

  speed+=gravity;

  if (y>=height) {
    speed = 0.95 * speed; // this slows the acceleration
    speed = -speed; // this reverses
  }
}
</pre>

Discussion:

- What functions might be useful here?
- How can we use the ````random()```` function to make things more interesting?
- What about multiple bouncing balls?

#### Arrays 
<pre>
final int numberOfValues = 10;

int[] values = new int[numberOfValues];

int n = 0;
while (n < values.length) {
  values[n] = (n+1)*(n+1);
  n = n + 1;
}

for (int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
  println(values[i]);
}
</pre>

**Things to notice**

- Just like functions are signified by `()`, arrays are signified by `[]`
- Arrays can be of any data type, but can't be mixed types
- `final` keyword
- `new` keyword
- Why not just use ten "normal" variables?
- Arrays and loops (either `for()` or `while()`) almost always show up
  together. If you use an array, you probably want a loop.

#### How to add more examples into Processing

For example, from Dan Shiffman's book *Learning Processing*

1. File -> Examples -> Add Examples
1. type `learning processing` in the search box
1. select the one we want

Now you can see all examples from the book 

1. File -> Examples -> Contributed Examples

The examples are also online [here](http://learningprocessing.com/examples)

#### Review arrays

A more advanced array example, and introduction to the very useful `map()`
function:

<pre>
float[] coswave; 

void setup() {
  size(900, 300);
  
  coswave = new float[width];
  for (int xPosition = 0; xPosition < width; xPosition++) {
    coswave[xPosition] = cos(radians(xPosition));
  }
  background(255);
  noLoop();
}

void draw() {
  for (int xPosition = 0; xPosition < width; xPosition++) {
    float waveHeight = map(coswave[xPosition], -1, 1, 0, height);
    point(xPosition, waveHeight);
  }
}
</pre>

**Remember**

- Arrays and loops (either `for()` or `while()`) almost always show up
  together. If you use an array, you probably want a loop.

**Things to notice**

* In the array example on Tuesday, 
I created the variable that would store the
array, and created the ten `int`s, all in one line. This time,
I created the variable that would store the array globally, 
and then I created the `float` variables inside of `setup()`.
Either way works; sometimes you will find you have to do it one
way or the other, but for the most part it's your choice.
* I used `noLoop()` because this only needed to run once. In fact
I didn't even need to use `draw()`, 
I could have put all the action into `setup()`
* How did I get the height of the wave to perfectly fit the height?
Practice using the `map()` function, it is incredibly useful
and works in Arduino also exactly the same way.

#### Classes

[this](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/simpleProcessingClassExample)

#### Text

<pre>
String message= "Important message";

void setup() {
  size(640, 360);

  // What fonts are available?
  // String[] fontList = PFont.list();
  // printArray(fontList);

  PFont f = createFont("monaco", 32);
  textFont(f, 32);
  color myFavoriteColor =color(255, 0, 0);

  fill(myFavoriteColor);
  textAlign(CENTER);
  text(message, width/2, height/2);
}
</pre>

**Things to notice**

* New datatype called `PFont`
* New datatype called `color`
* `fill()` and `textAlign()` will apply to any further texts or shapes until
they are changed

Some advanced examples using text are
[here](https://github.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media/tree/master/processingExamples)


#### Perlin Noise

````
void draw() {
  background(204);
  float n = random(0, width);
  line(n, 0, n, height);
}
````

What if we wanted the line to move in a more organic, lifelike
fashion? Organic things (e.g. butterflys, leaves blowing in the wind, clouds) 
don't jump instantly from one place to another,
they tend to move close to where they were last time

````
float offset = 0.0;

void draw() {
  background(204);
  offset = offset + .01;
  float n = noise(offset) * width;
  line(n, 0, n, height);
}
````

Things to notice:

* Why is the variable `offset` global? (Remember our discussion of variable
	scope)

#### Events

````
final int maxColors = 10;
color[] myColors = new color[maxColors];

int colorChoice = 0;

void setup() {
  size(600, 500);

  for (int i = 0; i < myColors.length; i ++ ) {
    myColors[i]=color(random(255), random(255), random(255));
  }
}

void draw() {
}

void mousePressed() {
  background(myColors[colorChoice]);
  colorChoice ++;
}
````

Things to notice:

* How does the background change if I never call `mousePressed()`?
`mousePressed()` is a *callback function*, meaning we have told
Processing that we are interested in this event, and if it occurs,
call this function. There are many different types of events available in
Processing, and you register an interest in them by creating a callback
function with the appropriate name. See *mouse* and *keyboard* 
in the Processing Reference Page.

* What happens if I click the mouse more than 10 times?

 	<li>Sources
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.springboard.com/blog/free-public-data-sets-data-science-project/">https://www.springboard.com/blog/free-public-data-sets-data-science-project/</a></li>

 	<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Source</a> of datasets from Alia</li>
	<li>Also look at examples from last spring. You can see their Github
	repositories <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/abudhabi_im_intro/student-github-repositories/">here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Format
<ul>
 	<li>CSV</li>
 	<li>Can use a spreadsheet program to open data from many formats and then save as CSV</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

##### How to process CSV files

Examples from Aaron Sherwood’s Introduction to Interactive Media <a href="https://github.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media">Github repository</a>
<ul>
 	<li>load/split strings: splitCommas.pde</li>
 	<li>load save table: tableSaveLoad.pde</li>
 	<li>forces: lettersGravityWind.pde</li>
</ul>

##### JSON: Another data format

JSON is another format for organizing data in a file. It is more complex than CSV, and again Processing provides functions for parsing JSON

<a href="https://processing.org/examples/loadsavejson.html">https://processing.org/examples/loadsavejson.html</a>

If you want to learn more about JSON and also XML, 
which yet another data format, 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqROpUNb2aY">here</a> 
is a good introductory video tutorial.

<h3>Generative Text</h3>
Pull words from a file (CSV or JSON), 
and by using `random()` in a clever way,
write poems or slogans or whatever

#### Transformations

<ul>
 	<li>Transforms move the canvas so you can draw in different places with the same code</li>
 	<li>Available 2D transforms are `translate()`, `rotate()`, and `scale()`. (Why the parenthesis?)</li>
 	<li>pushMatrix() and popMatrix() allow you to remember where the canvas was, and then return to it's last position</li>
</ul>
Draw a house at a given location, no transform:
<pre>void house(int x, int y)
{
  triangle(x + 15, y, x, y + 15, x + 30, y + 15);
  rect(x, y + 15, 30, 30);
  rect(x + 12, y + 30, 10, 15);
}</pre>
Same result, but using a transform:
<pre>void house(int x, int y)
{
  pushMatrix();
  translate(x, y);
  triangle(15, 0, 0, 15, 30, 15);
  rect(0, 15, 30, 30);
  rect(12, 30, 10, 15);
  popMatrix();
}
</pre>
</ul>

##### Rotation and scaling 

Work through <a href="https://processing.org/tutorials/transform2d/">this</a> tutorial
