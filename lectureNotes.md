### Tuesday 29 August 2023
#### Today
- Introduction (to the course, to each other, etc.)
- Introduction to programming (if we have time)

#### Introduction to class
* Join Discord (invitation link is in Brightspace)
* What are some examples of IM projects? 
	Spend a few minutes Googling 
	and put links in Discord
* What is IM?
	- Discussion
* Homework, projects, and grading
	- Most of you come into this class with different 
		backgrounds, skills, and knowledge, so 
		in IM, we grade by creativity, imagination, communication, 
        effort and progress, 
		not by a fixed level of accomplishment.
	- In IM we strongly encourage experimentation, thinking outside the box,
		and risk taking. 
		However taking risks is only possible 
		if failure doesn't have catastrophic results. 
		If failure results in a poor grade, 
		how does that encourage risk taking?
		- Discussion
		- MVP
* Phone and laptop policies
	- Discussion

* Introductions

- Syllabus etc.

- Introduction to programming in p5.js
- Primitive drawing functions
- How to tell where you are on the canvas
- Homework (see weekly schedule above)

#### Let's get started

##### Simple shapes in p5.js

Open the p5.js editor by visiting editor.p5.js

If you don't already have an account on p5.js you might want to do so now, or
after class. If you do it now you can save what you do in class

type this in:

```
function setup() {
  circle(50, 80, 30);
  square (80, 30, 40);
}
```

- `circle()`
- `square()`
- `ellipse()`
- `rect()`
- `fill()`

Spend a few minutes playing with this

### Thursday 31 August 2023
#### Today
- Accounts: p5js.org, Wordpress, Discord
- Review
- More about programming in p5.js
- Homework

##### Variables

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200,200);
  let foo = 20;
  circle(50,50, foo);
  square (90, 90, foo);
}
```

Now let's break this down one step at a time
- `setup()`
- `circle()`
- `let`
- `createCanvas()`

More primitive drawing functions

- `triangle()`
- `line()`
- `point()`

What does this all mean?
- Functions
- Variables
- Arguments or parameters
- Order of execution
- Computer does what you tell it to do, not what you are thinking
	- Errors happen when what you tell it is different from what you want it to
		do

Controlling color, fill, and stroke

- `stroke()`
- `noStroke()`
- `fill()`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, 180)`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, radians(180), CHORD)`
- `background(240)`

##### In-class exercise

Working in pairs, try to make a simple picture of a house 

##### What did you discover?
- Anything surprising?
- Any questions?

##### Big hint #1
Sometimes it's hard to know the coordinates of where you want to put stuff.
Wouldn't it be nice if you could put your mouse somewhere, and have the
computer tell you the coordinates of that point?

Good news everyone!

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200);
  background(220);
  print(mouseX + "," + mouseY);
}
```
What's going on here:
- `print()`
- Built-in variables `mouseX` and `mouseY`
- Build strings of characters using the `+` sign

but that's not very useful. Why does it only print the coordinates once?
- Hint: the function `setup()` only runs once at the beginning. Maybe there is
	another function that runs more than once?

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  print(mouseX + "," + mouseY);
}
```

# Woah!

If the `draw()` function runs continuously, can we use it to make things
change?

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200);
	let xPosition = 0;
}

function draw() {
  circle(xPosition, 50, 30);
	xPosition = xPosition + 1;
}
```

##### Why didn't that work?

Variable scope:

```
let xPosition; // this is now a global variable

function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200);
	xPosition = 0; // don't recreate the variable, but do initialize it
}

function draw() {
  circle(xPosition, 50, 30);
	xPosition = xPosition + 1;
}
```

##### Built-in variables
- `mouseX`, `mouseY`
- `width`, `height`
- many others; we will discover more as we go along


### Tuesday 5 Sep 2023
#### Today
- Review
- Homework
- Notes on variables
- Animation, Conditionals, Loops

##### Pause

Many of you already know the material we cover in these first few weeks
so why sit through class?
- This is not a coding class. This class includes design and critique
- Since you already know how to code, your creativity
	and critical thinking will be judged to a high standard
- I expect full attention and engagement. Doing something not related to class
	is rude, disrespectful, and will result in a reduced grade. The
	cellphone/laptop rules that we discussed last week is really about
	attention and respect, not about technology
- Please use the restroom before class. 
    We will take frequent breaks in class. 
    If you need an additional break please ask me when is a good time. 
    If you regularly require more frequent breaks please discuss with me
    privately or request an accommodation from the Moses Center

#### Homework
- [Homework schedule](https://intro.nyuadim.com/). Note the deadline
    "Assignments due midnight before first class of following week"
- Late homework
- Let's look at some of your homework

#### Notes on variables
Javascript is not a typed language: you don't need to declare
	a variable's type
- `let myNumber = 4.5;`
- `let myString = "the quick brown fox";`
- `let myArray = ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"];`
- `let myRandomNumber = random(255);`
- `let myRandomNumber = round(random(255));`

It's important to be aware of the difference between a variables name and
a variable's value

How can we find out what a variable's value is?
`print()` 

##### Notes:

- Local vs. Global variables
- Built-in variables

````
// Example usage of a global variable

let count; // this is now a global variable

function setup() {
  circle(50, 50, 30);
  count = 7; // the variable is initialized here
}

function draw() {
  count = count + 1; // not algebra!
  // The result of the right hand side calculation
  // replaces whatever value was stored in the variable
  // on the left side of the '=' sign
  // end result: the variable "count" is incremented by 1

  print (count);
}
````


#### Animation, Conditionals, Loops

##### Animation

Use the `draw()` function to draw something different in each frame. This can
be the location of a shape but you can manipulate anything such as color also:

The  `draw()` function is called once per frame. Think of it as drawing a new
page on a ["flip book"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_book)

````
let foo = 0;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {
  ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  foo = foo + 1;
}
````

By default, the previous frame is not erased. Sometimes this is useful.
Use the `background()` function to "paint" over any previous drawings. 

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(500, 500);
}

let triangleTopLeftX = 0;
let redValue = 255;

function draw() {
  // erase previous drawings
  background(10, 255, 255);

  // Move the triangle
  triangleTopLeftX = triangleTopLeftX + 1;

	// If the triangle reaches the right edge, move to the left edge
  if (triangleTopLeftX >= width) {
    triangleTopLeftX = 0;
  }

  // Change the value of red
  redValue = redValue - 1;

	//If red reaches a certian level, reset it
  if (redValue === 55) {
		redValue = 255;
	}

  // Select the fill for the triangle
  fill(redValue, redValue - 100, redValue - 100);

  // Draw the triangle
  triangle(
    triangleTopLeftX,
    20, // top left corner
    triangleTopLeftX + 100,
    30, // top right corner
    triangleTopLeftX + 50,
    200
  ); // bottom corner
  
  // Select the fill for the circle
  fill(10,20, 240);

  // Draw the circle
  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 30);
  print("mouse coordinates = " + mouseX + ", " + mouseY);
}

````

##### How often does the `draw()` loop run?

````
function setup() {
  frameRate(10);       // frameRate() is a function
  print(frameRate()); // framerate does not change immediately
}

function draw() {
  print(frameRate());
}
````

##### Conditionals 

One of the most important features of computer programming is the ability to
do different things based on the outcome of some previous event 

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {
  if (mouseIsPressed === true) {
    background(0, 0, 255);
  } else {
    background(200, 0, 0);
  }
}
````

**Notes**:
1. `mouseIsPressed` is another built-in variable. There are many others.
1. `mouseIsPressed` is a new type of data, namely a `boolean`, 
	which means it has
	 only one of two values, `true` or `false`
1. Note that `{` and `}` indicate the blocks
1. The `else` part of an `if()` statement is optional (what happens if we
	 remove it?)

In class exercise:
- Using the cursor to draw
- Now use a mouse press to clear the screen
- Clear the screen if the mouse is pressed inside a certain circle
- Combine these to create a primitive painting program

[Here](https://editor.p5js.org/michaelshiloh/sketches/izE0kdT_Q) is the
example that we developed in class

### Thursday 2 February 2023

#### Today
- Questions, review, etc
- Painting program
- Loops

##### Painting program
- Vladimir's
[paint program](https://editor.p5js.org/vsharkovski/sketches/0E5JFi1Pk)
- Jun's
[paint program](https://editor.p5js.org/ojmjunming/sketches/8GQSFuizb)

##### Loops

- `while()` is like `if()` but it keeps on doing it as long as condition is true
	- Whereas `if()` does it only once
	- The assumption is that something changes while you're doing the loop which
		might eventually make the condition false, otherwise you'd be stuck there
		forever
- `for()` is a variation in structure but basically does the same

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  let foo = 50; // create and initialize a variable

  while (foo < width) { // keep going as long as the condition is true
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
		// modify the variable so something different happens next time
    foo = foo + 50; 
  }
}
````

1. You should get in the habit of giving meaningful names to your variables.
	1. What is a better name for the variable foo?
1. What would happen if you replace the `while()` with `if()`?

Another example:

````
function setup() {
  let done = false;
  let counter = 0;
  while (!done) {
    print(counter++);
    if (counter >= 10) {
      done = true;
      print("done");
    }
  }
}
````

There is another way to make a loop using the keyword `for()`. The `for()`
loop structure combines the initialization step and the incrementation step
into the `for()` loop construction:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  // initialization, condition, and incrementation all in one line
  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50)  {
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  }
}
````

Which should you use? Whichever is easier for you to understand. Remember that
**most of the time spent programming is fixing problems**, and **whatever you
understand best will probably have fewer problems**.

Both `for()` loops and `while()` loops can be nested, meaning a loop inside a
loop:

```

function setup() {
  createCanvas(700, 700);
  background(230);
  fill(0);

  let yPos;
  let xPos;

  for (yPos = 30; yPos < height; yPos=yPos + 40) {
    for (xPos = 20; xPos<width; xPos=xPos + 40) {
      circle(xPos,yPos, 5);
    }
  }
}

```

Note that I've done all the above looping examples in `setup()` and not in
`draw()`, so there is no animation in these examples. Loops can be used in
`draw()` as well.


### Thursday 7 Sep 2023
#### Today
`random()`, `noise()`, and the concept of state

##### Randome numbers with `random()`

- `let foo = random();`
- `let foo = random(5);`
- `let foo = random(5, 22);`
- `let foo = random([some array]);`

Random example 1:

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(700, 700);
  background(230);
  fill(0);

  for (let yPos = 30; yPos < height; yPos=yPos + 40) {
    for (let xPos = 20; xPos<width; xPos=xPos + 40) {
      circle(xPos,yPos, random(1, 5));
    }
  }
}

```

Random example 2:
```
function draw() {}

function mouseClicked() {
  background(50 * random(6),
             50 * random(6),
             50 * random(6));
}
```

##### Perlin Noise

```
function draw() {
  background(204);
  let n = random(0, width);
  line(n, 0, n, height);
}
```

What if we wanted the line to move in a more organic, lifelike
fashion? Organic things (e.g. butterflies, leaves blowing in the wind, clouds) 
don't jump instantly from one place to another,
they tend to move close to where they were last time

Perlin noise example 1:
```
let offset = 0.0;

function draw() {
  background(204);
  offset = offset + .01;
  let n = noise(offset) * width;
  line(n, 0, n, height);
}
```
Perlin noise example 2:

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);

  for (let yPos = 0; yPos < height; yPos = yPos + 40) {
    for (let xPos = 0; xPos < width; xPos = xPos + 40) {
      offset = offset + .1;
      square(xPos+noise(offset)*20, yPos+noise(offset)*20, 40);
    }
  }
}
let offset = 0.0;
```

Things to notice:

- Why is the variable `offset` global? (Remember our discussion of variable
	scope)

#### Today

- Arrays of objects

#### Functions

Every time you use one of the built-in *commands*, you are really using (or
more properly *calling*) a built-in function. Functions are a very important
building block of programming, and in addition to using built-in functions,
you can also create your own. In fact, you've already been doing that, when
you created the `setup()` and `draw()` functions. In the case of
`setup()` and `draw()` you have to use those names, but when you create other
functions you can make up your own names. Just like variables names, good 
function names make your programs easier to understand.

Why create your own functions?

- Reuse (if it's something you might do again)
- Clarity (remember your three important audiences: yourself, others learning
	from you, me when I grade your work)
- Easier to debug (what is debugging?)
	- One of the most powerful ways to approach
	a bug is to reproduce it with simplest possible example. 
	This is much easier when the thing that's causing
	the problem is already a function.
- Modularity
- Flexibility (with good choice of parameters)

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  // initialization, condition, and incrementation all in one line
  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50)  {
    rect(foo, 50, 40, 40);
    line(foo, 50, foo+20, 30);
    line(foo+20, 30, foo+40, 50);
  }
}
````

Now let's make a function called `drawOneHouse()`. If we want to
draw a house at different locations, we need a way to tell
the function `drawOneHouse()` where to put the house. Functions accommodate
this by allowing us to pass information into the function by putting 
that information in the parenthesis. In the function, we store this
information in temporary variables that we can use within the function:

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  for (let foo = 50; foo < width; foo = foo + 50) {
    drawOneHouseAt(foo);
  }
}

function drawOneHouseAt( x) {
  rect(x, 50, 40, 40);
  line(x, 50, x+20, 30);
  line(x+20, 30, x+40, 50);
}
````

**Notes**
1. I've said this before and I'll keep saying: 
	**Choose descriptive names for your variables and functions!** 
	`foo` is a bad name, `xPos` is a good name,
	 `houseXPos` is a better name.
1. The value of `foo` (50, 100, 150 ...) is the information passed to the
	 function so that the function can do it's work. The proper name for this
	 information is an **argument**
1. The variable `x` is a temporary variable that **only exists in the function**.
	 This variable is used to store the argument that was passed into the
	 function so that the function can do its work. Once the function is
	 finished, this variable is no longer needed and is destroyed. 
	 A variable used in this way is called a **parameter**
1. Functions may take zero, one, or multiple arguments. When you write 
	a function, *you* decide how many arguments you need. For example, we might
	have included the house size or roof height or house y location or color. 
1. Functions can return information as well, for example as the `random()`
   function does. Functions can either return one piece of information, or
   none.  We will see later how to do this. 

#### Variable Scope (again)

```
let foo;  // this is a global variable, visible in all functions

function setup() {
  foo = 7;
}

function draw() {

  print(foo);

  let bar; // this is a local variable, visible only inside of draw()

  for (let i = 0; i < width/2; i++) { 
    // i is a local variable visible only inside this for() loop
    ellipse(i, height/2, 10,15);
  }
}
```

#### Arrays

[Really simple array
example](https://editor.p5js.org/michaelshiloh/sketches/8TB1ONGFA)


#### Object oriented programming

A simple bouncing ball example:
1. First, let's make a ball bounce off all 4 walls of the canvas
2. Identify carefully and isolate what's in `setup()`, 
	what does the moving, and what does the drawing?

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  xPos = width / 2;
  yPos = random(100, 300);
  xSpeed = 4;
  ySpeed = 7;
}

function draw() {
  background(220);

  // move the ball
  xPos += xSpeed;
  yPos += ySpeed;

  // check for collisions
  // check first for left and right wall
  if (xPos <= 15 || xPos >= (width-15)) {
    xSpeed = -xSpeed;
  }

  // do the same for the ceiling and the floor
  if (yPos <= 15 || yPos >= (height-15)) {
    ySpeed = -ySpeed;
  }

  circle(xPos, yPos, 30);
}
```

3. Now carefully write the class:
	1. The code in `setup()` is most likely the *constructor*. You can think
       of the `constructor` as the `setup()` function of the class
	1. The moving code and the drawing code are most likely 
		the two *member functions* you'll need. Member functions are the
        functions that make the object do stuff

```
class BouncingBall {
  constructor() {
    this.xPos = width / 2;
    this.yPos = random(100, 300);
    this.xSpeed = 4;
    this.ySpeed = 7;
  }

  move() {
    // move the ball
    this.xPos += this.xSpeed;
    this.yPos += this.ySpeed;
  }

  checkForCollisions() {
    // check first for left and right wall
    if (this.xPos <= 15 || this.xPos >= width - 15) {
      this.xSpeed = -this.xSpeed;
    }

    // do the same for the ceiling and the floor
    if (this.yPos <= 15 || this.yPos >= height - 15) {
      this.ySpeed = -this.ySpeed;
    }
  }

  draw() {
    circle(this.xPos, this.yPos, 30);
  }
}

let myBouncingBall;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  myBouncingBall = new BouncingBall();
}

function draw() {
  background(240);
  myBouncingBall.move();
  myBouncingBall.checkForCollisions();
  myBouncingBall.draw();
}
```

Notes
- What does `this` mean?
- Functions in a class are mostly like any other functions 
	- For example, it's often useful to pass initialization information to the
		constructor, like
		[this](https://editor.p5js.org/mangtronix/sketches/-7sWqG_Bu) example

#### Arrays of objects

Here then is the bouncing ball example, this time creating 10 
balls, and storing them in an array:

```
class BouncingBall {
  constructor(xSpeed0, ySpeed0) {
    this.xPos = width / 2;
    this.yPos = random(100, 300);
    this.xSpeed = xSpeed0;
    this.ySpeed = ySpeed0;
  }

  move() {
    // move the ball
    this.xPos += this.xSpeed;
    this.yPos += this.ySpeed;
  }

  checkForCollisions() {
    // check first for left and right wall
    if (this.xPos <= 15 || this.xPos >= width - 15) {
      this.xSpeed = -this.xSpeed;
    }

    // do the same for the ceiling and the floor
    if (this.yPos <= 15 || this.yPos >= height - 15) {
      this.ySpeed = -this.ySpeed;
    }
  }

  draw() {
    circle(this.xPos, this.yPos, 30);
  }
}

let ball = [];

function setup() {
  
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // each ball will have a slightly different
    // initial speed in the X axis, but all balls
    // will have the same speed in the Y axis
    ball[i] = new BouncingBall(i + 1, 2);
  }
}

function draw() {
  background(240);

  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ball[i].move();
    ball[i].checkForCollisions();
    ball[i].draw();
  }
}
```

[Here](https://p5js.org/examples/arrays-array-objects.html)
is another example showing how to make an array of objects


##### State

From Wikipedia:

"... a system is described as stateful if it is designed to remember preceding
events or user interactions; the remembered information is called the state of
the system. "

Example:

```
let currentState = 0;

function setup() {
  background(currentState);
}

function draw() {}

function mouseClicked() {
  if (currentState === 0) {
    currentState = 255;
  } else {
    currentState = 0;
  }
  background(currentState);
}
```
#### The `modulo()` function

How to use the modulo function to make something happen less often than every
frame: 

```
let shade = 0;
let changeAmount = 5;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(shade);

  // change the shade only on every other frame
  if (frameCount % 2 == 0) {
    shade += changeAmount;

    // make sure the shade stays between 0 and 255
    if (shade <= 0 || shade >= 255) {
      changeAmount = -changeAmount;
    }
  }
}
```

What's the difference between these two `if` statements:

```
 if ("d" === key) {
```

```
 if (key === "d") {
```

##### Text on the canvas

###### The most basic usage

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);

  text("My Important Message", width / 2, height / 2);
}
````

###### Different Fonts

````
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
	textFont("Courier New", 25);

	text("My Important Message", width / 2, height / 2);
}
````

Fonts that seem to be available are 'Courier New' (monospace),
and 'Helvetica' (non-monospace)

You can also load your own fonts but that requires uploading them to the p5.js
server

Help->Reference->LoadFont

**Important**: Note that p5.js is asynchronous, 
meaning that `setup()` will continue even if the `loadFont()` hasn't finished.
There are two ways to force your program to wait for the font to load:

1. Use `preLoad()`
1. Specify an optional callback function in `loadFont()`

###### Selecting one of many fonts

Note that loading a font takes time, so if you expect to use multiple
fonts it's best to preload all of them, and then switch between
them using [`textFont()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/textFont)

###### Other things to do with text

There are of course many other things you can do with text. You can look at 
Help->Reference->Typography and File->Examples->Typography for ideas and
examples.

##### Data Visualization

What is data visualization? Here are some examples:

- [Ben Fry](http://benfry.com/allstreets/)
- [Aaron Koblin](http://www.aaronkoblin.com/project/flight-patterns)
- [Jer Thorp](https://www.jerthorp.com/portfolio) e.g. Cascade

###### Finding data

- https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/rt_data_access.shtml
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
- Professor' Mathura's [list of data
	sources](https://github.com/MathuraMG/ConnectionsLabSpring22/blob/master/Week_3_JSON_Fetch/README.md#list-of-data-sources)
 	
Format

- The most common format is CSV. You can create your own CSV file from a 
	spreadsheet because most programs
	(Excel, OpenOffice Calc, Google Sheets) can export any table in CSV format
- Other formats are JSON and XML. We won't spend any time on them, but there
	are p5.js libraries for these.

##### Worked example: Getting and working with a CSV file

- A [database](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/) of energy generated by wind turbines
- Click "Get Data"
- Scroll down a bit to "Tabular Data: CSV format" and click on "CSV
format". 
	- This will download a `.zip` file.
- Unzip the file. 
	- This will create `uswtdb_v4_1_20210721.csv`
- This is a plain text file; you can view it with a text editor
	- You will see that the first line is the heading of each column
	- Some of the fields are numerical (e.g. case_id)
	- Some of the fields are text (e.g. t_state, t_county)
	- Some of the fields are missing (e.g. faa_ors, faa_asn)
- Now you can load this file into an array of `Strings` and then process each
	line one at a time, pulling out individual fields:

```
/*
 * example to process a CSV file containing data
 * about wind turbines in the USA
 * Source: https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/
 */

// An array of strings to hold the entire file
let strings = [];

// For scaling, we want to know the minimum and maximum latitude and longitude
let minLat;
let maxLat;
let minLong;
let maxLong;

function preload() {
  // The text from the file is loaded into an array.
  strings = loadStrings("uswtdb_v4_3_20220114.csv");
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(500, 400);
  background(235);

  // Did we succeed to load anything?
  if (strings == null) {
    print("failed to load the file, stopping here");

    // this is an endless loop; it's a common way
    // to prevent a program from continuing when
    // something is so wrong that there is no sense
    // in continuing
    while (true) {}
  }

  print(
    "strings loaded from file successfully, read " + strings.length + " lines"
  );

  // Find the minimum and maximum latitude
  // and longitude
  findMinMaxLatLong();
}

function findMinMaxLatLong() {
  let singleRow = [];

  // loop over each row in the file
  for (let csvRowNumber = 1; csvRowNumber < strings.length; csvRowNumber++) {
    // get a single row and split that row
    // into individual words
    singleRow = split(strings[csvRowNumber], ",");

    // We know that the last two fields are the
    // latitude and longitude and so they are
    // numerical:
    let longitude = float(singleRow[25]);
    let latitude = float(singleRow[26]);

    // The file may be missing a field, in which case
    // the converstion to a float might have failed
    if (isNaN(longitude) || isNaN(latitude)) {
      print("conversion to float failed; skipping row " + csvRowNumber);
    } else {
      if (csvRowNumber == 1) {
        minLat = latitude - 10;
        maxLat = latitude + 10;
        minLong = longitude - 10;
        maxLong = longitude + 10;
      }

      if (latitude < minLat) minLat = latitude;
      if (latitude > maxLat) maxLat = latitude;
      if (longitude < minLong) minLong = longitude;
      if (longitude > maxLong) maxLong = longitude;
    }
  } // end of for() loop

  print("Latitude (min, max) = (" + minLat + "," + maxLat + ") ");
  print("Longitude (min, max) = (" + minLong + "," + maxLong + ")");
} // end of findMinMaxLatLong

let csvRowNumber = 1;
// Skip the first line, since we know it's a header

function draw() {
  let singleRow = [];

  // get a single row and split that row into
  // individual words
  singleRow = split(strings[csvRowNumber], ",");

  // This really slows things
  // down so use only when debugging
  //println("Row " +
  // csvRowNumber +
  //   " contains " +
  //   singleRow.length +
  //   " fields" );

  // We know that the last two fields are the
  // latitude and longitude and so they are
  // numerical:
  let longitude = float(singleRow[25]);
  let latitude = float(singleRow[26]);

  // use only when debugging
  // println("Latitude " +
  // latitude +
  //   " longitude " +
  //   longitude );

  // Check for non-numerical strings.
  if (isNaN(longitude) || isNaN(latitude)) {
    print("conversion to float failed; skipping row " + csvRowNumber);
  } else {
    // scale that to fit on our canvas
    //println(csvRowNumber);
    let ypos = map(latitude, minLat, maxLat, 0, height);
    let xpos = map(longitude, minLong, maxLong, 0, width);

    // Put a mark there
    point(xpos, ypos);
  } // end of valid data

  csvRowNumber++;
  if (csvRowNumber >= strings.length) {
    println("finished");
    noLoop();
  }
}

```

Things to notice:
1. The `split()` function does half the magic
1. The `int()` or `float()` function does much of the rest
1. data files might have errors in them and you need to defend your program
	 against them
1. `loop()` and `noLoop()` can be used anytime you want to start or stop the
	 `draw()` function from repeating

##### JSON and XML: Other file formats

JSON and XML are other format for organizing data in a file. 
They are more complex than CSV, and again p5.js provides functions.

##### Generative Text
Pull words from a CSV file 
and by using `random()` in a clever way,
write poems or slogans or whatever. 

Here is a terribly lame example:

```
/*
Generate poetry from a file of words
 the file has words in this format:

 roses,red,violets,blue,dream,disneyland

 we will refer to them as:

 item1,color1,item2,color2,verb,location

 and construct a poem:

 item1 are color1, item2 are color2
 when I verb I verb to location
 */

// Let's put the index of the word into numbers:
const ITEM1 = 0;
const COLOR1 = 1;
const ITEM2 = 2;
const COLOR2 = 3;
const VERB = 4;
const LOCATION = 5;
// final means that I will not change these variables
// It is conventional to use all caps for variable names that will not change


let strings = [];

function setup() {

  // The text from the file is loaded into an array.
  strings = loadStrings("words.csv");

  // How many lines did we get?
 // println("strings array contains this many lines: " + strings.length);
}

let csvRowNumber = 0;

function draw() {
  let singleRow = [];

  // First line: "item1 are color1, item2 are color2"

  // Pick a random number, round that number DOWN to a whole number,
  // and split that row into individual words
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  // get item1
  let item1 = singleRow[ITEM1] + " are " ;

  // Now keep doing this for each word
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  // get color1
  let color1 = singleRow[COLOR1] + ", " ;

  // Now the second half of the first line: "violets are blue"
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  let item2 = singleRow[ITEM2] + " are " ;
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  // get color2
  let color2 =  singleRow[COLOR2];

  // that's the end of the first line of the poem
  print(item1 + " are " + color1 ", " + item2 + " are " + color2);

  // Now the second line: when I verb I verb of location

  message = "When I " ;
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  message = message + singleRow[VERB]);
  print(" I " );
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  message = message + singleRow[VERB]);
  print(" to the " );
  singleRow = split(strings[int (random(strings.length))], ',');
  message = message + singleRow[LOCATION]);

  // that's the end of the second line of the poem so start a new line
  // and also put an extra blank line
  print('\n');
  print('\n');

  noLoop(); // Wait for a mouse click then do it again
}

// If you click the mouse, allow the draw() function to resume
function mouseClicked() {
  loop();
}
```

Here are the words to feed it. Put these into a file called `words.csv`:

```
roses,red,violets,blue,dream,disneyland
robots,silver,pencils,grey,run,supermarket
goldfish,orange,motors,white,turn,workbench
books,multicolored,lamposts,azure,swim,island
computers,black,mice,pink,squeak,home
```

(Time permitting)
#### In class exercise

- Have students make a scroller in pairs
- Show how to get by char
    - E.g. using `.substring` as in
      [this](https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/text-and-type/) example
- Make scroller again by char
- Add randomness/Perlin noise for placement
- Look at circle letters in pairs, come up with questions and explanations
