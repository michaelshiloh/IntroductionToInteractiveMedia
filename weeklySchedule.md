1. Learning section of [p5js.org](https://p5js.org/learn/)

Make a self-portrait using p5.js.
- The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not
	interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no
	drawing using the mouse)
- The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change
	while we look at it)
- The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice using
	the simple drawing functions.
- In your Github repository, create a new folder named `Feb1`
	- Upload your program into the new folder, with the extension `.js`.
		- If you use any variables, chose good names.
	- Upload a screenshot of your portrait into the new folder

### Week 6 (March 1, 3) Computer vision

### Week 7 (March 8, 10) Midterm

#### Production Assignment progress Tuesday March 8

As you finish your project, Keep in mind the design considerations that we
learned about earlier in the semester: affordances, signifiers, etc. 
For instance, think about where you place buttons and other controls, and how
you signify their functions.

I suggest that you aim to finish your project by Tuesday or Wednesday, leaving
you a couple of days for user testing. See if your users can play the game
without any additional instructions from you; the game should be self
explanatory. Observe them playing, take notes, and request feedback, and see
how you can improve.

On Tuesday we will do a quick status check in class, and I 
I expect each of you to demonstrate your project complete 
or very nearly complete. 

#### Production Assignment Due Thursday March 10

Finish the midterm

Midterm project

Make a game using everything you have learned so far
- Can be one or more players
- The game must not be violent (no shooting or fighting)
- Must include
	- At least one shape
	- At least one image
	- At least one sound
	- At least one on-screen text
	- Object Oriented Programming
- The game must start with a screen giving instructions, and must wait there
	until a button or key (your choice) is pressed
- After the game is won or lost, there must be a way to restart the game
	without closing and restarting the program
- A sense of humor and whimsy is encouraged. Think outside the box, don't be
	traditional
- Keep in mind the design considerations that we learned about earlier in the semester: affordances, signifiers, etc
- Documentation must be excellent
	- Include photos, sketches, GIFS as appropriate
- Code must be extremely well organized and commented
	- Include block at the beginning of the code
		with your name, name of the project, class, and date
	- Explain each function except for setup() and draw()
		- What does it do
		- What the arguments are
		- How it works
	- Tidy the code
		- Unfortunately this also join all the arguments in a function 
			so if broke any long lines to make them fit in the window
			you will have to do it again
	- Excellent comments, especially for any confusing or tricky parts
	- Use functions as needed to organize your program
	- Use excellent variable, function, object, and class names

#### Production Assignment Due Thursday March 10

- Perform user testing on your game
- Solicit feedback
- Implement suggestions that you feel are relevant 

#### Production Assignment Due Thursday March 24

- Get your kit from the bookstore
- You will need a USB-A port. If you have a modern laptop with only USB-C
	ports, you will need to borrow (from Academic Tech if you are on campus) or
	buy (if you are off-campus) a USB-A to USB-C adapter.
- Prepare a space for working with electronics
	- Have your kits ready to use in class
	- Have some space to work. There are many small components in the kit that
	will be easily lost, so ideally be seated at a table or desk with clear
	space around you.
- Install the Arduino IDE from
	[here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). 
	If you are on Windows chose either the 
	Windows Installer ("Windows Win 7 and newer")
	or install from 
	the Microsoft App Store ("Windows app Win 8.1 or 10")
- In your kit is a bundle of jumper wires 
	that might be tied with a very tight ziptie 
	that must be carefully removed. Please do this before class because 
	it may take you a while to find the right tool. 
	A sharp pair of scissors should work. A knife might damage the wires 
	and hurt you.

![](media/jumpersWithCableTieRemoved.jpg)

- **Be careful not to damage the wires or yourselves!**

- (If you are curious, you may read all about the kit
	[here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v41))

	- Use your Arduino for power as we did in class on Thursday. 
	- You are not required to use Arduino inputs or outputs, 
	but you may do so if you wish.
	- You might want to visit the IM lab for supplies such as copper tape,
		aluminium foil, or longer wires, but you are encouraged to be creative and
		use unusual items. One year a student used a trash can!
	- [Examples](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/switches/#Get_Creative_With_Switches)
	- Document your switch 
	(description, process, pictures, video, problems, and discoveries) 
	in README.md in a new folder named march31

### Week 8 (March 29, 31) Arduino Digital Input, Analog Input and Output

#### Production Assignment Due Tuesday April 5

Get information from at least one analog sensor and at least one digital
sensor (switch), and use this information to control at least two LEDs, one in
a digital fashion and the other in an analog fashion, in some creative way,
non-obvious, or delightful way. 
- A bad example would be a momentary switch (pushbutton) that, when pressed,
	turns on an LED, or a potentiometer, that when turned, controls the
	brightness of an LED
- A good example would be a potentiometer, that when turns, causes an LED to
	blink your name in Morse Code, but only while you are turning the
	potentiometer, and a momentary switch (pushbutton) that, when pressed,
	causes an LED to change brightness (bonus: the speed of change is controlled
	by the same potentiometer)
- Document your project
in README.md in a new folder april5. Include:
	- Description
	- Your development process
	- Picture(s) 
	- Video (embed your video in your README.md. An example is in Ayesha's
		[documentation](https://github.com/ayeshaahmed13/IntroToIM/tree/main/midtermProject/README.md)
		of her midterm project). If the video is too large you may put it on
		Youtube or Vimeo and put a link in your documentation.
	- Problem(s), if any
	- Discoverie(s), if any
	- Schematic, which may be hand drawn or computer created
- Upload your Arduino code into the same folder with the proper extension
	(.ino)

#### Reading Assignment Due Tuesday April 5

The first two readings are for discussion (Ryan and Shaikha to lead)
- [Physical Computing’s Greatest hits and
	misses](https://www.tigoe.com/blog/category/physicalcomputing/176/)
- [Making Interactive Art: Set the Stage, Then Shut Up and
	Listen](https://www.tigoe.com/blog/category/physicalcomputing/405/)

Ryan and Shaikha will post the questions on Discord on Monday evening, allowing
everyone time to think and come up with answers. In class we will discuss
first in breakout rooms, and then we will come back together and Ryan and
Shaikha will lead us in a group discussion.

This reading is not for discussion:
- Read about the [voltage
	divider](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers). Don’t worry
	about the theory too much or the section on level shifting. The important
	thing is to absorb a little of the concept of a voltage divider.

### Week 9 (April 5, 7): Sound, Servo Motor, Mapping

#### Production Assignment Due Tuesday April 12

Working in groups of two, make a musical instrument using at least one digital
sensor and one analog sensor. 
- You may (but you are not required to) use sensors and other components that
	we have not learned about, either ones from your kit or from the IM lab.
- You may use other any other materials you wish. The IM lab is a good
	resource with things such as wood, plastic, and the junk bins (ask a lab
	assistant where these are)
- Group assignments:
	- Ryan and Noora
	- Mishel and Abdullah
	- Dhabia and Kevin 
	- Liam and Shaikha
	- Faizan and Aisha
	- Avinash and Ayesha
	- Basil, Pranav, and Daniel 

- Document your project
in README.md in a new folder april5. Include:
	- Description
	- Overview of your development process
	- Description of anything that stood out to you, accompanied by code segment
		or schematic or drawing as appropriate. Code should always be properly
		formatted text and never an image.
	- Picture(s) 
	- Video (embed your video in your README.md. An example is in Ayesha's
		[documentation](https://github.com/ayeshaahmed13/IntroToIM/tree/main/midtermProject/README.md)
		of her midterm project). If the video is too large you may put it on
		Youtube or Vimeo and put a link in your documentation.
	- Problem(s), if any
	- Discoverie(s), if any
	- Schematic, which may be hand drawn or computer created
	- References to any tutorials,examples, inspiration, books, etc. that you
		used
- Upload your Arduino code into the same folder with the proper extension
	(.ino)

#### Reading Assignment Due Tuesday April 12

The first two readings are for discussion (Avinash and Basil to lead)
- [A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction
	Design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/)
- [A follow-up
	article](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/responses.html)
It is important that you understand the concepts behind BlinkWithoutDelay.
[Here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#arduino-multitasking-resources)
are links to various other explanations of the same thing. Browse them, and
read one deeply enough that you understand. Come to class with questions if
none of these help.

### Week 10 (April 12, 14) Serial Communication, Introduce Final Project

#### Production Assignment Due Tuesday April 19

Work in the groups from class to finish the three in-class examples exercises: 
- make something that uses only one sensor  on arduino and makes the ellipse
	in p5 move on the horizontal axis, in the middle of the screen, and nothing
	on arduino is controlled by p5 
- make something that controls the LED brightness from p5 
- take the [gravity wind example](https://editor.p5js.org/aaronsherwood/sketches/I7iQrNCul) and make it so
	every time the ball bounces one led lights up and then turns off, and you
	can control the wind from one analog sensor 
- Each person, not just one for a group, should document your work
	- In a new folder called april19
		- Arduino code for each exercise
		- Link to your sketch on p5js.org
		- README.md with a video of the LED lighting up with the ball bouncing

In a new folder called `finalProject`, in a file called `journal.md`, Write a
preliminary concept for your final project, which must incorporate both
Arduino and P5.  
- Create a physically interactive system of your choice that relies on a
	computer for some sort of processing or data analysis.
	Your focus should be on careful and timely
	sensing of the relevant actions of the person or people that you’re
	designing this for, and on clear, prompt, and effective responses. Any
	interactive system is going to involve systems of listening, thinking, and
	speaking from both parties. Whether it involves one cycle or many, the
	exchange should be engaging.
- You may work alone or in groups
	- Groups may consist of up to 3 people but for 3 people you'll have to meet
		me to convince me that your project really needs three people.
- Examples are in the syllabus and in our first lesson plan

#### Reading Assignment Due Tuesday April 19

[Design Meets
Disability](https://intro.nyuadim.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Design_meets_disability.pdf) (Abdullah and Aisha to lead)

- Finalized concept for the project
- Description of what your Arduino program will do with each input and output
	and what it will send to and/or receive from P5
- Description of what P5 program will do and what it will send to and/or
	receive from Arduino
- Whether you’re doing it as solo or group, and if in a group who is your
	partner. Only one of you needs to write this documentation, but your partner
	should link to it from his/her `journal.md`

### Week 11 (April 19, 21) DC motors, Construction and Debugging, Final
